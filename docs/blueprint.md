## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3399FF), reminiscent of the limitless depth of the sky, instilling curiosity and promoting focus and clarity, like a clear sky encouraging exploration and learning. Chosen to avoid cliches, since many educational apps pick primary colors from the warmer side of the color wheel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E5F2FF), subtly echoing the hue of the primary color, it evokes the innocence of notebook paper or a whiteboard, a familiar academic medium. It is almost white, but ever-so-slightly-blue so it doesn't feel clinical. (Almost monochrome palettes like this help avoid distracting the user.)
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF) will complement the analogous primary hue and increase contrast, adding flair and pop to enhance call to actions, it embodies an electrifying surge of inspiration and energy.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', sans-serif.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different subjects or features, ensuring they are intuitive and complement the clean design.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with ample whitespace to avoid overwhelming students. Prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
